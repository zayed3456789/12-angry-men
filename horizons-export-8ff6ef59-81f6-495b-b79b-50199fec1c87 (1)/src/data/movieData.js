  paragraphs: [
    "\"12 Angry Men\" is a 1957 American courtroom drama film directed by Sidney Lumet, adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. The film tells the story of a jury of 12 men as they deliberate the conviction or acquittal of an 18-year-old defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt, forcing the jurors to question their morals and values.",
    "Set almost entirely within a single jury room on a sweltering summer day, the film masterfully builds tension as the jurors, initially nearly unanimous in their vote for conviction, begin to re-examine the evidence. Juror 8, played by Henry Fonda, is the lone initial dissenter, who patiently and persuasively argues for a more thorough consideration of the facts.",
    "The film explores themes of justice, prejudice, conformity, and the fallibility of human perception. Each juror brings their own biases, experiences, and personalities into the deliberation room, creating a microcosm of society. The claustrophobic setting and rising heat mirror the escalating tension among the jurors.",
    "\"12 Angry Men\" is celebrated for its powerful performances from an ensemble cast, its taut direction, and its intelligent, thought-provoking script. It remains a timeless classic, frequently studied for its depiction of group dynamics and the American justice system."
